# Evolution2

Decided to start fresh on the evolution game with a new idea.

To run the game, install node, `npm install`, `npm start`, then navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Creating Levels

The game is hosted at https://numso.github.io/evolution2.  
The editor is hosted at https://numso.github.io/evolution2/editor.html.  
After you create a level: give it a name and hit save. Then go into the game and put `?map=YOUR_NAME` at the end.

Example: If I named my map `demo`, then I would go to https://numso.github.io/evolution2?map=demo

Note:: Maps are currently saved locally. So you can only play maps that you've created on your own computer.
